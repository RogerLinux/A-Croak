A-Croak is an app that trains corpora into vectors, the vectors can help us know how close the two words are.
This app is inspired by Tomas Mikolov's work, WordVec and based on his thesis.

We can begin to train text and find the similarities of each pair of words.
We just run the script below

./running_example.sh

P.S. Users should build their own lexicons before training words, check "lexicon" file to get sample lexicon.
