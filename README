A-Croak is an app that trains corpora into vectors, the vectors can help us know how close the two words are.
This app is inspired by Tomas Mikolov's work, WordVec and based on his theory.

To build, you do not need to run make, you just run INSTALL instead.
INSTALL would produce an app named A-Croak
